I got the error when doing this:

        $post = new Post();

        $userID = Auth::user()->id;


        $input->user_id = $userID;
        $input->postTitle = request('postTitle');
        $input->postDescription = request('postDescription');
        $input->save();


DD get me number 3 ID which is correct, but the variable Auth always gave me a problem "Creating default object from empty value".

Instead I went for this syntax:

        Post::create([
            'user_id' => Auth::user()->id,
            'postTitle' => request('postTitle'),
            'postDescription' => request('postDescription')
        ]);

It worked but it told me to put the names into the fillable variable.

After that It worked
